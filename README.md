# Overview

My goal for this project was to learn Android Studio and work to learn how to develop a mobile app.
I had a rough time of things, but I would like more time with Android Studio. It has a lot to offer.

I expanded on a game of hangman that I wrote in Kotlin language. I thought it would be pretty simple
adding to working code. I was wrong. The differences of using a touch screen, visually oriented platform
was a big difference.

This helped me to learn knew techniques and tackle new challenges though. I think I was starting to
make some good progress before I ran out of time.

# Development Environment

For programming I used the Kotlin language in Android Studio.
This required an SDK from Android and installation of various libraries.

Using the Android Studio was really challenging for me. I didn't come by success easily.
I could use more time with it but I ran out.

# Future Work

* I want to add more animation to this eventually
* I also want to build a better dataset to hold multiple puzzles
* Next, I will be attaching a cloud storage to this app
